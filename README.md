# ðŸŒžSmart Tracker: Catching Light with PID Power

Hey there! Welcome to the GitHub repo for my **Dual-Axis Light Tracker** project.  
This is where an **Arduino** gets smart â€” using four sensors and two servos to constantly face the brightest light.  
Think of it as a mini, self-adjusting sunflower! ðŸŒ»  

This isn't your average light-following robot; the **horizontal movement** is controlled by a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** Control Loop.  
Thatâ€™s the fancy bit that makes sure the tracker finds the light super-fast, locks on without wobbling, and ignores the small jitters that would throw off a simpler system.

##  What We're Trying to Achieve

- **True Dual-Axis:** Follow the light in all directions â€” left/right (pan) and up/down (tilt).  
- **Smooth Sailing:** Use PID logic to keep the tracker steady and accurate when it finds the sweet spot.  
- **Smart Sensing:** Use four LDRs in a smart cross-pattern to generate a precise error signal that tells the Arduino exactly where to move.

##  Parts List (What You'll Need)

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Arduino Uno** | The brain of the operation (or any compatible microcontroller). |
| **Hobby Servos (9g)** | Two servos â€” one for pan, one for tilt. |
| **LDRs (Light Sensors)** | Four sensors mounted in a quadrant. |
| **Resistors** | Four 10kÎ© pull-down resistors for the LDR inputs. |
| **Breadboard & Wires** | For prototyping and connections. |

Important Build Tip:**  
> Mount your four LDRs with small dividers between them!  
> These create the shadows that help generate the "error" signal for accurate tracking.

The Code Magic â€” PID Explained

The magic happens with the **PID loop** on the horizontal axis.  
Instead of just guessing, it calculates *exactly* how much to move based on three factors:

- **Proportional (Kp):** How wrong we are right now.  
- **Integral (Ki):** How wrong we've been over time (helps overcome friction).  
- **Derivative (Kd):** How quickly the error is changing (helps prevent overshooting).  

**PID Formula:**

```math
Movement = (K_p Ã— Current Error) + (K_i Ã— Accumulated Error) + (K_d Ã— Rate of Error Change)
 Tuning the System (The Fun Challenge!)
Parameter	Description	Suggested Value
Kp (Proportional)	Main control strength. Too high â†’ oscillations.	0.5
Ki (Integral)	Helps overcome steady-state error. Too high â†’ overshoot.	0.001
Kd (Derivative)	Damps oscillations. Too high â†’ too sensitive.	5.0

Includes Integral Anti-Windup using:
integral_H = constrain(...)
to keep the system stable when servos hit their max/min positions (0Â° or 180Â°).

 Ready to Run?
Upload the code to your Arduino.

Open the Serial Monitor to view:

H_Error â†’ Horizontal error

PID_Out â†’ Servo correction signal

Tune your Kp, Ki, Kd values for the smoothest performance.
